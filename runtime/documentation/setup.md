This configuration is not recommended for any production enviroment, just as a testbed for api workings within the project leto.gg
- get an ec2 server on AWS!
- configure your networking(dont mess this up lol)
- install IPFS(Kubo is what I used)
- get your services setup(run the ipfs daemon and check the badbits registry on start automatically)
- configure your api(I am using flask but I will probably change that very soon)
